Simple website displaying information from a MySQL Database using PHP.
The following tutorial is for those to follow to set up and host the project on their own. There were some issues when trying to set this up during the presentation, so I felt a step-by-step guide for you to do at home would be better.

## Part 1: Getting Started
First, go to [000webhost.com](http://000webhost.com) and create an account. I have heard that your Chaminade Email doesnt work here, so try and use a personal email if you would like to. Signing in using Google may be beneficial here.

Afterwards, you should be given a screen similar to the one below, prompting you to create a new website. Click "Create New Site" and then enter a unique name for your website in the next form. Make sure you click the button outlined in purple on the top-right of the page and not any of the links in the bottom half of the image.

This form will prompt you to create a domain name for your website. Because this is a free service, the domain will have `.000webhostapp.com` at the end of the name.

Once you have successfully submitted the form, you have created a new, hosted website for yourself. 

## Part 2: Creating a Database
After you have finished creating the website. You should be greeted with a dashboard page. The left-hand side of the page should feature a navigation menu. Click on the "Tools" link, which should be the second link available and right under "Build a Website".
