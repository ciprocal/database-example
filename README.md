# database-example
Simple website displaying information from a MySQL Database using PHP.
The following tutorial is for those to follow to set up and host the project on their own. There were some issues when trying to set this up during the presentation, so I felt a step-by-step guide for you to do at home would be better.

## Getting Started - Hosting
First, go to [000webhost.com](http://000webhost.com) and create an account. I have heard that your Chaminade Email doesnt work here, so try and use a personal email if you would like to. Signing in using Google may be beneficial here.
